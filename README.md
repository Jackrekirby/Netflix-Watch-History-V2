[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/95d46111-07bd-4699-9765-bc07f7fd78a5/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/watch-history-explorer/deploys)

A website that sorts through your Netflix watch history and produces a list of your watched films and TV shows.

Improves upon version 1 by:
* Using React for state handling (over vanilla JS).
* Communicates with [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-GB) to collect statistics, posters and check title names for the films and TV shows.
* Improves upon the original film - tv show sorting algorithm, in part, due to its ability to check titles on TMDB.
